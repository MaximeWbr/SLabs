# SLabs_exercice

## Description

The metropolis of Toulouse would like to have a weather and air quality analysis application to measure and understand the impact of the environmental actions it is implementing.

Through this application, it is possible to visualize a sample of data and compare them with the air quality or between them. Moreover it is possible to choose the data displayed by selecting the n last received data or a specific date. For this purpose we have several meteorological databases and a database of the region that records the air quality.

### Prerequisites

- Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Install pip3 and update with ``pip3 install --upgrade pip`` (used version 21.0)
- Download matplotlib ``pip3 install matplotlib `` and update it with ``pip3 install --upgrade matplotlib`` 
- Installez Flask ``pip3 install flask``

### Installation

Create a Workspace folder at the desired location.
Run the following command in your Workspace ``git clone https://github.com/MaximeWbr/SLabs.git`` to clone the git.

## Get started

In order to launch the application go to the **SLabs** folder and run the **webSite.py** script. 
``python3 webSite.py``

Once the script launched, you should see something like:
``Works on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to exit)``
The last step is to copy and paste the url address into your favorite web browser to view the application's home page .

**Warning** this application has been designed under **OSX**, it should be possible to launch it under Linux but under Windows some changes will probably have to be made in the configuration file **config.py**.
